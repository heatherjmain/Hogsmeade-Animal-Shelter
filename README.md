# Hogsmeade-Animal-Shelter

Available on Heroku - https://hogsmeade-animal-shelter.herokuapp.com/

This is the first project I undertook during week 5 of the 16 week CodeClan immersive programming course.  The project brief is shown below.


```
Animal Shelter

The Animal Shelter accepts orphaned or stray animals and takes care of them until they can be adopted by a new owner.
The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the animals. 
Animals may take a while to be trained up and made healthy before being available for adoption.

They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners.

MVP:

A list of all their animals and their admission date
Mark an animal as being adoptable/not adoptable
Assign an animal to a new owner
List all the owners and their adopted animals


Possible Extensions:

CRUD actions for animals/owners
Have separate pages for animals ready for adoption and ones still in training/vet care
Search for animals by breed/type
Any other ideas you might come up with
```




It's a RESTful app which implements full CRUD functionality and demonstrates the use of -

  * Ruby
  * Sinatra
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * PostgreSQL
  * TDD

Features to be added -
  * I would like to add a filter functionality to my data.
  * I would also like to improve the accessibility and responsiveness of the application.
